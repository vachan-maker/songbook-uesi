      <description>Psalms 100:5;Hebrews 4:16
God is good! We sing and shout it,
God is good! We celebrate,
God is good! No more we doubt it,
God is good! We know it’s true.
And when I think of His love for me,
My heart fills with praise
And I feel like dancing,
For in His heart there is room for me,
And I run with arms open wide</description>

      <description>Meekness and majesty,
Manhood and deity,
In perfect harmony,
The man who is God,
Lord of eternity, dwells in humanity,
Kneels in humility and washes our feet.
Oh! What a mystery,
Meekness and majesty,
Bow down and worship,
For this is your God, this is your God.
Father’s pure radiance, perfect in
innocence,
Yet learns obedience, to death on a cross,
Suffering to give us life,
conquering through sacrifice,
And as they crucify, prays ‘Father forgive.</description>
