<h3>356. God is Good All the Time</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Key: E</p>
  <article><p>God is good all the time<br>
He put a song of praise,<br>
In this heart of mine,<br>
God is good all the time,<br>
Through the darkest night,<br>
His light will shine, God is good,<br>
God is good, all the time!</p>
<p>If you’re walking through the valley,<br>
There are shadows all around;<br>
Do not fear, He will guide you,<br>
He will keep you safe and sound,<br>
He has promised, to never leave you,<br>
Nor forsake you and His word is true.</p>
<p>We were sinners, so unworthy,<br>
Still for us He chose to die,<br>
He filled us with His Holy Spirit,<br>
Now we can stand and testify,<br>
That His love is everlasting,<br>
And His mercies, they will never end.</p>
<p>Though I may not understand,<br>
All the plans you’ve made for me,<br>
My life is in your hands,<br>
And through the eyes of faith,<br>
I can clearly see.</p>
