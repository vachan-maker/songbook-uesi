<h3>344. In the Stars His Handiwork I See</h3>
<p>Ralph Carmichael</p>
<p>Key: </p>
  <article><p>In the stars His handiwork I see,<br>
On the winds He speaks of majesty<br>
Though He ruleth over land and sea<br>
What is that to me?<br>
I will celebrate Nativity,<br>
For it has its place in history<br>
Sure, He came to set His people free<br>
What is that to me?</p>
<p>Till one day I met Him face to face<br>
And I felt the wonder of His grace,<br>
Then I knew that He was more than just a<br>
God who didn’t care,<br>
That lived a way out there, and</p>
<p>Now He walks beside me day by day<br>
Ever watching o’er me lest I stray<br>
Helping me to find that narrow way<br>
He’s everything to me</p>
