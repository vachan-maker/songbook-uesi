  <article><p>Who Am I, that the Lord of all the earth<br>
Would care to know my name<br>
Who am I, that the bright and morning stars<br>
Would choose to light the way<br>
For my ever wandering heart<br>
Not because of who I am<br>
But because of what you’ve done<br>
Not because of what I’ve done<br>
But because of who You are</p>
<p>Chorus:<br>
I am a flower quickly fading<br>
Here today and gone tomorrow<br>
A wave tossed in the ocean<br>
A vapor in the wind<br>
Still You hear me when I’m calling<br>
Lord, You catch me when I’m falling<br>
And you’ve told me who I am<br>
I am Yours, I am yours</p>
<p>Who am I, that the eyes that see my sin<br>
Would look on me with love and<br>
watch me rise again.<br>
Who am I, that the Voice that calmed the sea<br>
Would call out through the rain<br>
And calm the storm in me<br>
not because of who I am<br>
but because of what You done<br>
not because of what I done<br>
but because of who you are</p>
