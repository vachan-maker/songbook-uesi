<h3>453. Hark! the Herald Angels Sing</h3>
<p>Charles Wesley</p>
<p>Key: </p>
  <article><p>Peace on earth, and mercy mild,<br>
God and sinners reconciled.<br>
Joyful, all ye nations rise,<br>
Join the triumph of the skies;<br>
With the angelic host proclaim,<br>
‘Christ is born in Bethlehem!’<br>
Hark! The herald – angels sing<br>
‘Glory to the new-born King!’<br>
Christ by highest heav’n adored,<br>
Christ, the everlasting Lord,<br>
Late in time, behold Him come,<br>
Offspring of the virgin’s womb!<br>
Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see!<br>
Hail, the ‘incarnate Deity!<br>
Pleased as man with men to dwell,<br>
Jesus, our Immanuel.<br>
Hail, the heav’n-born Prince of Peace<br>
Hail, the Son of righteousness!<br>
Light and life to all He brings,<br>
Ris’n with healing in His wings.<br>
Mild He lays His glory by,<br>
Born that, man no more may die;<br>
Born to raise the son of earth,<br>
Born to give them second birth.</p>
