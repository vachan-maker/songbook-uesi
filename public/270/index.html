<p>Key: </p>
  <article><p>No other name but the name of Jesus<br>
No other name but the name of the Lord<br>
No other name but the name of Jesus<br>
Is worthy of glory, and worthy of honor<br>
And worthy of power and all praise<br>
His name is exalted, far above the earth<br>
His name is high above the heavens<br>
His name is exalted, far above the earth<br>
Give glory and honor and praise unto<br>
His Name<br>
The Lord said Heâ€™ll answer, all of our<br>
prayers<br>
When we cry out in His Name<br>
His name is power, awesome to behold<br>
Give glory and honor and praise unto<br>
His Name</p>
