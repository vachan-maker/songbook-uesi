  <article><p>I am not skilled to understand<br>
What God has willed, what God has<br>
planned<br>
I only know at His right hand<br>
Stands one who is my Saviour<br>
I take Him at His word and deed<br>
Christ died to save me; this I read<br>
And in my heart I find a need<br>
Of Him to be my savior<br>
That He would leave His place on high<br>
And come for sinful man to die</p>
<p>You count it strange, so once did I<br>
Before I met my Saviour<br>
My Saviour loves, My Saviour lives<br>
My Saviourâ€™s always there for me<br>
My God: He was, my God; He is<br>
My God is always gonna be<br>
(2)<br>
Yes, living, dying, let me bring<br>
My strength, my solace from this spring;<br>
That He who lives to be my King<br>
Once died to be my Saviour<br>
That He would leave His place on high<br>
And come for sinful man to die<br>
You count it strange, so once did I<br>
Before I knew my Saviour</p>
