      <description>Thou art worthy (2)
Thou art worthy. Oh! Lord,
To receive glory, glory and honour,
Glory and honour and power.
For Thou hast created, hast all things
created,
Thou hast created all things,
And for Thy pleasure they are created,
Thou art worthy Oh! Lord.
He is worthy, He is worthy,
Worthy the Lamb to receive,
Power and riches, wisdom and honour,
Blessing and glory and might,
For He has been slain and redeemed</description>
