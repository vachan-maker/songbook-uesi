      <description>You are holy (You are holy)
You are mighty (You are mighty)
You are worthy (You are worthy)
Worthy of praise (worthy of praise)
I will follow (I will follow)
I will listen (I will listen)
I will love You (I will love You)
All of my days (all of my days)
I will sing to, and worship
The King who is worthy
I will love and adore Him
And I will bow down before Him</description>
