      <description>Lord, I lift Your name on high,
Lord, I love to sing Your praises,
I’m so glad, You’re in my life,
I’m so glad, You came to save us.
You came from heaven to earth,
To show the way,
From the earth to the cross,
My debts to pay,
From the cross to the grave,
From the grave to the sky,
Lord, I lift Your name on high</description>
