      <description>All the way my Savior leads me;
What have I to ask beside?
Can I doubt His tender mercy,
Who through life has been my Guide?
Heav’nly peace, divinest comfort,
Here by faith in Him to dwell!
For I know, what-e’er befall me,
Jesus doeth all things well;
For I know, whate’er befall me,
Jesus doeth all things well.
2.All the way my Savior leads me
Cheers each winding path I tread;</description>
