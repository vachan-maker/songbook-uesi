      <description>To God be the glory! Great things He
has done,
So loved He the world that He gave us
His Son,
Who yielded His life,
an atonement for sin,
And opened the life-gate that all may
go in
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
Let the earth hear His voice.
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! Let the people rejoice.
Oh! Come to the Father through Jesus, the Son,
And give Him the glory, great things</description>
