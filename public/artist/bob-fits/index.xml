      <description>Father in heaven, how we love you.
We lift your Name in all the earth.
May your kingdom, be established in
our praises,
As your people declare your mighty
works.
Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
Who was and is, and is, to come.
Blessed be the Lord God Almighty.
Who reigns forever more.</description>
