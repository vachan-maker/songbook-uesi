      <description>When Peace, Like A River, Attendeth My Way,
When Sorrows Like Sea Billows Roll;
Whatever My Lot, Thou Hast Taught Me To Say,
It Is Well, It Is Well With My Soul.
It Is Well With My Soul,
It Is Well, It Is Well With My Soul.
Though Satan Should Buffet, Though Trials Should Come,
Let This Blest Assurance Control,
That Christ Hath Regarded My Helpless Estate,
And Hath Shed His Own Blood For My Soul.</description>
