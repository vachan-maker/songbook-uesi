that saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
was blind, but now I see.
&lsquo;Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
and grace my fears relieved;
how precious did that grace appear
the hour I first believed.
Through many dangers, toils, and snares,
I have already come;
&rsquo;tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
and grace will lead me home." />
