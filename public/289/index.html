When I look into your holiness
When I gaze into your loveliness
When all things that surround me
Become shadows in the light of you,
When I’ve found the joy of reaching
your heart,
When my will becomes enthroned in
your love,
When all things that surround me
Become shadows in the light of you.
I worship you (2)
The reason I live, is to worship you (2)" />
