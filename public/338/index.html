<h3>338. I Have Found A Friend in Jesus, He is Everything to Me</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Key: </p>
  <article><p>I have found a friend in Jesus, He’s everything to me,<br>
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;<br>
The Lily of the Valley, in Him alone I see,<br>
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole.</p>
<p>In sorrow He’s my comfort, in trouble He’s my stay,<br>
He tells me every care on Him to roll; Alleluia!<br>
He’s the Lily of the Valley, the Bright and Morning Star,<br>
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.</p>
<p>He all my grieves has taken, and all my sorrows borne,<br>
In temptations He’s my strong and mighty tower;<br>
I have all for Him forsaken, and all my idols torn,<br>
From my heart, and now He keeps me by His power.</p>
<p>Though all the world forsake me and Satan tempts me so,<br>
Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal<br>
He’s the Lily of the Valley, the Bright and Morning Star,<br>
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.</p>
<p>He will never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me here,<br>
While I live by faith and do His blessed will;<br>
A wall of fire about me, I’ve nothing now to fear,<br>
With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill.</p>
<p>Then sweeping up to glory to see His blessed face,<br>
Where the rivers of delight shall ever roll; Alleluia!<br>
He’s the Lily of the Valley, the Bright and Morning Star,<br>
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul…</p>
