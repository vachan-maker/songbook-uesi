Of famine and darkness and sword
Still, we are the voice in the desert, crying

Behold He comes, riding on the clouds
Shining like the sun, at the trumpets call
So lift your voice, it’s the year of Jubilee" />

  <article><p>These are the days of Elijah<br>
Declaring the word of the Lord<br>
And these are the days of your<br>
servant, Moses<br>
Righteousness being restored<br>
And though these are days of great trials<br>
Of famine and darkness and sword<br>
Still, we are the voice in the desert, crying<br>
“Prepare ye the way of the Lord!”</p>
<p>Behold He comes, riding on the clouds<br>
Shining like the sun, at the trumpets call<br>
So lift your voice, it’s the year of Jubilee<br>
And out of Zion’s hill, salvation comes.</p>
<p>And these are the days of Ezekiel,<br>
The dry bones becoming as flesh<br>
And these are the days of your<br>
servant, David,<br>
Rebuilding the temple of praise.<br>
And these are the days of the harvest,<br>
The fields are as white in the world.<br>
And we are the laborers in your vineyard,<br>
Declaring the word of the Lord!<br>
(Behold He)</p>
<p>There’s no God like Jehovah,<br>
There’s no God like Jehovah,<br>
There’s no God like Jehovah!</p>
