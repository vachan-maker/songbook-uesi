<h3>271. These are The Days of Elijah</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Key: </p>
  <article><p>These are the days of Elijah<br>
Declaring the word of the Lord<br>
And these are the days of your<br>
servant, Moses<br>
Righteousness being restored<br>
And though these are days of great trials<br>
Of famine and darkness and sword<br>
Still, we are the voice in the desert, crying<br>
“Prepare ye the way of the Lord!”</p>
<p>Behold He comes, riding on the clouds<br>
Shining like the sun, at the trumpets call<br>
So lift your voice, it’s the year of Jubilee<br>
And out of Zion’s hill, salvation comes.</p>
<p>And these are the days of Ezekiel,<br>
The dry bones becoming as flesh<br>
And these are the days of your<br>
servant, David,<br>
Rebuilding the temple of praise.<br>
And these are the days of the harvest,<br>
The fields are as white in the world.<br>
And we are the laborers in your vineyard,<br>
Declaring the word of the Lord!<br>
(Behold He)</p>
<p>There’s no God like Jehovah,<br>
There’s no God like Jehovah,<br>
There’s no God like Jehovah!</p>
