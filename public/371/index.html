Alas, and did my Savior bleed?
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For sinners such as I ?
[verse 2]
Was it for crimes that I had done,
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!
[verse 3]
Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut its glories in,
When God, the mighty maker died
For His the creature’s sin." />
