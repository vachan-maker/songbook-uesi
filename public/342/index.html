  <article><p>Even though I walk through the valley<br>
Of the shadow of death<br>
Your perfect love is casting out fear</p>
<p>And even when I&rsquo;m caught in the middle<br>
Of the storms of this life<br>
I won&rsquo;t turn back, I know You are near</p>
<p>And I will fear no evil<br>
For my God is with me<br>
And if my God is with me<br>
Whom then shall I fear?<br>
Whom then shall I fear?</p>
<p>Oh no, You never let go<br>
Through the calm and through the storm<br>
Oh no, You never let go<br>
In every high and every low<br>
Oh no, You never let go<br>
Lord, You never let go of me</p>
<p>And I can see a light that is coming<br>
For the heart that holds on<br>
A glorious light beyond all compare</p>
<p>And there will be an end to these troubles<br>
But until that day comes<br>
We&rsquo;ll live to know You here on the earth</p>
<p>And I will fear no evil<br>
For my God is with me<br>
And if my God is with me<br>
Whom then shall I fear?<br>
Whom then shall I fear?</p>
<p>Oh no, You never let go<br>
Through the calm and through the storm<br>
Oh no, You never let go<br>
In every high and every low<br>
Oh no, You never let go<br>
Lord, You never let go of me</p>
<p>Yes, I can see a light that is coming<br>
For the heart that holds on<br>
And there will be an end to these troubles<br>
But until that day comes<br>
Still I will praise You<br>
Still I will praise You</p>
<p>Yes, I can see a light that is coming<br>
For the heart that holds on<br>
And there will be an end to these troubles<br>
But until that day comes<br>
Still I will praise You<br>
Still I will praise You</p>
<p>Oh no, You never let go<br>
Through the calm and through the storm<br>
Oh no, You never let go<br>
In every high and every low<br>
Oh no, You never let go<br>
Lord, You never let go of me<br>
Oh, You never let go<br>
You never let go</p>
<p>Oh no, You never let go<br>
Through the calm and through the storm<br>
Oh no, You never let go<br>
In every high and every low<br>
Oh no, You never let go<br>
Lord, You never let go of me</p>
<p>You never let, You never let go<br>
You never let go of me</p>
