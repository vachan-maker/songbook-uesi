  <article><p>To God be the glory! Great things He<br>
has done,<br>
So loved He the world that He gave us<br>
His Son,<br>
Who yielded His life,<br>
an atonement for sin,<br>
And opened the life-gate that all may<br>
go in</p>
<p>Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!<br>
Let the earth hear His voice.<br>
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! <br>
Let the people rejoice.<br>
Oh! Come to the Father through Jesus, <br>
the Son,<br>
And give Him the glory, great things<br>
He has done.</p>
<p>Oh! Perfect redemption, the purchase<br>
of blood,<br>
To every believer, the promise of God,<br>
The vilest offender who truly believes,<br>
That moment from Jesus a pardon<br>
receives.<br>
Great things He has taught us,<br>
Great things He has done,<br>
And great our rejoicing through Jesus,<br>
the Son.<br>
But purer and higher and greater will be,<br>
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus<br>
we see!</p>
