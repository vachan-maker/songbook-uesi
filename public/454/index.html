  <article><p>Joy to the world! the Lord has come,<br>
Let earth receive her King,<br>
Let every heart prepare Him room,<br>
And heaven and nature sing,<br>
And heaven and nature sing,<br>
And heaven and heaven and nature sing.</p>
<p>Joy to the world! The Saviour reigns:<br>
Let men their songs employ,<br>
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains,<br>
Repeat the sounding joy,<br>
Repeat the sounding joy,<br>
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.<br>
No more let sin and sorrows grow,<br>
Nor thorns infest the ground,<br>
He comes to make His blessings flow,</p>
<p>Far as the curse is found,<br>
Far as the curse is found,<br>
Far as, far as the curse is found.<br>
He rules the world with truth and grace,</p>
<p>And makes the nations prove<br>
The glories of His righteousness,<br>
And wonders of His love,<br>
And wonders of His love,<br>
And wonders, wonders of His love</p>
