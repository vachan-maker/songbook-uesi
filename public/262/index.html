<h3>262. Here and now</h3>
<p>Paul Baloche</p>
<p>Key: </p>
  <article><p>Here and now, here in this moment<br>
Here and now I turn to you<br>
All that my searching heart has longed<br>
for can be found</p>
<p>‘Cause you’re in this moment,<br>
here and now<br>
What majesty, what mystery,<br>
The God of all eternity<br>
Stepped into time and gave His life for me</p>
<p>Your hand is seen in galaxies,<br>
Yet Your Spirit dwells in me<br>
So vast and yet you’re still within our reach</p>
<p>There is nowhere you can’t be found<br>
Nothing on earth could ever keep Your Presence out</p>
<p>Here and now, here in this moment<br>
Here and now I turn to you<br>
All that my searching heart has longed for can be found<br>
‘Cause you’re in this moment, here<br>
and now<br>
You’re in this moment here and now</p>
