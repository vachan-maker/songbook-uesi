Above all kings,
Above all nature,

Above all wisdom, and
All the ways of man,

Before the world began.
Above all kingdoms,
Above all thrones,
Above all wonders,
The world has ever known,
Above all wealth,
And treasures of the earth,
There’s no way to measure,
What You’re worth.
Crucified!
Laid behind a stone,
You lived to die,
Rejected and alone," />
