<h3>279. Are you tired of chasing pretty rainbows?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Key: </p>
  <article><p>Are you tired of chasing pretty<br>
rainbows?<br>
And are you tired of spinning ‘round<br>
and ‘round?<br>
Wrap up all the shattered dreams of<br>
your life<br>
And at the feet of Jesus lay them down</p>
<p>Give them all, give them all, give them<br>
all to Jesus<br>
Shattered dreams, wounded hearts<br>
and broken toys<br>
Give them all, give them all, give them<br>
all to Jesus<br>
And He will turn your sorrow into joy<br>
He never said, you’d only see sunshine<br>
He never said, there’d be no rain<br>
He only promised a heart full of singing<br>
About the very things that once<br>
brought pain<br>
And He will turn your sorrow into joy</p>
