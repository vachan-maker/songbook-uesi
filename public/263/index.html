<h3>263. Our God Is An Awesome God</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Key: </p>
  <article><p>When He rolls up His sleeves<br>
He ain’t just putting on the ritz<br>
(Our God is an awesome God)<br>
There’s thunder in His footsteps<br>
And lightning in His fists<br>
(Our God is an awesome God)<br>
And the Lord wasn’t joking<br>
When He kicked ‘em out of Eden<br>
It wasn’t for no reason<br>
That He shed His blood<br>
His return is very close<br>
And so you better be believing that
Our God is an awesome God</p>
<p>Our God is an awesome God<br>
He reigns from heaven above<br>
With wisdom, power, and love<br>
Our God is an awesome God</p>
<p>And when the sky was starless<br>
In the void of the night<br>
(Our God is an awesome God)<br>
He spoke into the darkness<br>
And created the light<br>
(Our God is an awesome God)<br>
Judgment and wrath He poured out on Sodom</p>
<p>Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross
I hope that we have not<br>
Too quickly forgotten that<br>
Our God is an awesome God<br>
Our God is an awesome God<br>
(Our God is an awesome God)<br>
He reigns from heaven above<br>
With wisdom, power, and love<br>
Our God is an awesome God<br>
Our God is an awesome God<br>
Our God is an awesome God</p>
