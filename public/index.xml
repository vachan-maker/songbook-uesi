      <description>Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens;
Lord, with me abide;
When other helpers fail and comforts
flee,
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.
Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass
away;
Change and decay in all around I see—
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.
I need Thy presence every passing hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the</description>

      <description>Above all powers,
Above all kings,
Above all nature,
And all created things,
Above all wisdom, and
All the ways of man,
You were here,
Before the world began.
Above all kingdoms,
Above all thrones,
Above all wonders,
The world has ever known,
Above all wealth,
And treasures of the earth,
There’s no way to measure,
What You’re worth.
Crucified!
Laid behind a stone,
You lived to die,
Rejected and alone,</description>

      <description>Psalms 19:1
All heavens declare, the glory of the
risen Lord
Who can compare with the beauty
of the risen Lord
Forever, He will be, the Lamb upon the
throne,
I gladly bow my knee and worship Him
alone.
I will proclaim the glory of the risen Lord,
Who once was slain to reconcile man
to God
Forever, you will be, the Lamb upon
the throne,
I gladly bow my knee and worship you</description>

Things in the past, things yet unseen
Wishes and dreams that are yet to come true
All of my hopes, all of my plans
My heart and my hands are lifted to You
Lord, I offer my life to you</description>

      <description>Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
was blind, but now I see.
&amp;lsquo;Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
and grace my fears relieved;
how precious did that grace appear
the hour I first believed.
Through many dangers, toils, and snares,
I have already come;
&amp;rsquo;tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
and grace will lead me home.</description>

      <description>Are you tired of chasing pretty
rainbows?
And are you tired of spinning ‘round
and ‘round?
Wrap up all the shattered dreams of
your life
And at the feet of Jesus lay them down
Give them all, give them all, give them
all to Jesus
Shattered dreams, wounded hearts
and broken toys
Give them all, give them all, give them
all to Jesus
And He will turn your sorrow into joy</description>

The river of God fills our mouths with laughter
And we rejoice for the river is here
The river of God is teeming with life</description>

And I will fear no evil
For my God is with me
And if my God is with me
Whom then shall I fear?
Whom then shall I fear?</description>

      <description>1 Have thine own way, Lord!
Have thine own way!
Thou art the potter,
I am the clay.
Mold me and make me
after thy will,
while I am waiting,
yielded and still.
2 Have thine own way, Lord!
Have thine own way!
Search me and try me,
Savior today!
Wash me just now, Lord,
wash me just now,
as in thy presence
humbly I bow.

Here and now I turn to you
All that my searching heart has longed
for can be found
‘Cause you’re in this moment,
here and now
What majesty, what mystery,
The God of all eternity
Stepped into time and gave His life for me
Your hand is seen in galaxies,
Yet Your Spirit dwells in me
So vast and yet you’re still within our reach</description>

cherubim and seraphim falling down before thee,
which wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.
Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide thee,

I just live from day to day,
I don’t borrow from its sunshine,
For its skies may turn to grey,
I don’t worry over the future,
For I know what Jesus said,
That today He’ll walk beside me,
For He knows what is ahead. Many things about tomorrow
I don’t seem to understand
But I know who holds tomorrow
And I know who holds my hand.</description>

Here in the love of Christ I stand.
In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe!

In perfect harmony,
The man who is God,
Lord of eternity, dwells in humanity,
Kneels in humility and washes our feet.
Oh! What a mystery,
Meekness and majesty,
Bow down and worship,
For this is your God, this is your God.
Father’s pure radiance, perfect in
innocence,
Yet learns obedience, to death on a cross,
Suffering to give us life,
conquering through sacrifice,
And as they crucify, prays ‘Father forgive.</description>

Lord, there is none like you,
All of my days, I want to praise,
The wonders of your mighty love,

Tower of refuge and strength,
Let every breath, all that I am,
Never cease to worship you.
Shout to the Lord, all the earth, let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the King,
Mountains bow down and the seas will

Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.

And the Lord wasn’t joking
When He kicked ‘em out of Eden
It wasn’t for no reason
That He shed His blood
His return is very close

Righteousness being restored
And though these are days of great trials
Of famine and darkness and sword
Still, we are the voice in the desert, crying
“Prepare ye the way of the Lord!”
Behold He comes, riding on the clouds
Shining like the sun, at the trumpets call
So lift your voice, it’s the year of Jubilee</description>

All is stripped away,
And I simply come
Longing just to bring
Something that’s of worth
That will bless your heart
I’ll bring you more than a song,
For a song in itself
Is not what you have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You’re looking into my heart
I’m coming back to the heart of
worship
And it’s all about you,</description>

      <description>Where there seems to be no way,
He works in ways we cannot see,
He will make a way for me
He will be my guide,
Hold me closely to His side,
With love and strength for each new day,
He will make a way. (2)
By a road way in the wilderness,
He will lead me,
And rivers in the desert will I see,
Heaven and earth will fade,</description>

      <description>Who Am I, that the Lord of all the earth
Would care to know my name
Who am I, that the bright and morning stars
Would choose to light the way
For my ever wandering heart
Not because of who I am
But because of what you’ve done
Not because of what I’ve done
But because of who You are
Chorus:
I am a flower quickly fading
Here today and gone tomorrow</description>

And by Your grace we’re redeemed,
To walk in the truth

And minister life in your name

Taking my sin, my cross, my shame
Rising up again I bless Your name</description>

Restored exceeding joy

I stand on higher ground
Your praise rose in my heart
And made this valley sing
This is how we overcome</description>

      <description>Your love is amazing,
Steady and unchanging
Your love is a mountain,
Firm beneath my feet
Your love is a mystery,
how you gently lift me
When I am surrounded, your love carries me
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, your love makes me sing
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, your love makes me sing
Your love is surprising,
I can feel it rising
All the joy that’s growing deep inside of me
Every time I see you,</description>
