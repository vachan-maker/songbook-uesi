      <description>Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens;
Lord, with me abide;
When other helpers fail and comforts
flee,
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.
Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass
away;
Change and decay in all around I see—
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.
I need Thy presence every passing hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the</description>

      <description>Above all powers,
Above all kings,
Above all nature,
And all created things,
Above all wisdom, and
All the ways of man,
You were here,
Before the world began.
Above all kingdoms,
Above all thrones,
Above all wonders,
The world has ever known,
Above all wealth,
And treasures of the earth,
There’s no way to measure,
What You’re worth.
Crucified!
Laid behind a stone,
You lived to die,
Rejected and alone,</description>

All heavens declare, the glory of the
risen Lord
Who can compare with the beauty
of the risen Lord
Forever, He will be, the Lamb upon the
throne,
I gladly bow my knee and worship Him
alone.
I will proclaim the glory of the risen Lord,
Who once was slain to reconcile man
to God
Forever, you will be, the Lamb upon
the throne,
I gladly bow my knee and worship you</description>

      <description>Are you tired of chasing pretty
rainbows?
And are you tired of spinning ‘round
and ‘round?
Wrap up all the shattered dreams of
your life
And at the feet of Jesus lay them down
Give them all, give them all, give them
all to Jesus
Shattered dreams, wounded hearts
and broken toys
Give them all, give them all, give them
all to Jesus
And He will turn your sorrow into joy</description>

And I long to worship You.
I want You more than gold or silver, only
You can satisfy,
You alone are the real joy giver,</description>

The river of God sets my feet a- dancing
The river of God fills our hearts with cheer
The river of God fills our mouths with laughter
And we rejoice for the river is here
The river of God is teeming with life</description>

Father God, I wonder how I managed
to exist
Without the knowledge of your

And Your loving care,
But now I am Your child, I am adopted in
Your family,
And I will never be alone,
‘Cause Father God, You’re there
beside me.
I will sing Your praises (3) Forever more.</description>

And in my heart I find a need
Of Him to be my savior
That He would leave His place on high
And come for sinful man to die</description>

      <description>Lord I stand in the midst of a multitude
Of those from every tribe and tongue
We are your people redeemed by
your blood
Rescued from death by your love
There are no words
Good enough to thank You
There are no words to express my praise
But I will lift up my voice
And sing from my heart
With all of my strength
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
To the Lamb</description>

From the earth to the cross,
My debts to pay,
From the cross to the grave,
From the grave to the sky,

      <description>Meekness and majesty,
Manhood and deity,
In perfect harmony,
The man who is God,
Lord of eternity, dwells in humanity,
Kneels in humility and washes our feet.
Oh! What a mystery,
Meekness and majesty,
Bow down and worship,
For this is your God, this is your God.
Father’s pure radiance, perfect in
innocence,
Yet learns obedience, to death on a cross,
Suffering to give us life,
conquering through sacrifice,
And as they crucify, prays ‘Father forgive.</description>

When He kicked ‘em out of Eden
It wasn’t for no reason
That He shed His blood
His return is very close
And so you better be believing that Our God is an awesome God</description>

Righteousness being restored
And though these are days of great trials
Of famine and darkness and sword
Still, we are the voice in the desert, crying
“Prepare ye the way of the Lord!”
Behold He comes, riding on the clouds
Shining like the sun, at the trumpets call
So lift your voice, it’s the year of Jubilee</description>

All is stripped away,
And I simply come
Longing just to bring
Something that’s of worth
That will bless your heart
I’ll bring you more than a song,
For a song in itself
Is not what you have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You’re looking into my heart
I’m coming back to the heart of
worship
And it’s all about you,</description>
