And rivers in the desert will I see,

He works in ways we cannot see,<br>
He will make a way for me<br>
He will be my guide,<br>
Hold me closely to His side,<br>
With love and strength for each new day,<br>
He will make a way. (2)</p>
<p>By a road way in the wilderness,<br>
He will lead me,<br>
And rivers in the desert will I see,<br>
Heaven and earth will fade,<br>
But His word will still remain,<br>
He will do something new today.</p>
