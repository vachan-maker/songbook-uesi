Count your blessings; see what

Count your blessings;
name them one by one;
And it will surprise you what
The Lord hath done.

And you will be singing as the days<br>

lands and gold.<br>
Think that Christ has promised you<br>
His wealth untold;<br>
Count your many blessings,<br>

Your reward in heaven, nor your<br>
Lord on high.</li>

or small,<br>
Do not be disheartened, God is<br>
over all;<br>
Count your many blessings, angels<br>
will attend,<br>
Help and comfort give you to your<br>
journey’s end.</p>
