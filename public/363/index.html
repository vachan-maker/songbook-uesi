  <article><p>He&rsquo;s still working on me<br>
To make me what I need to be<br>
It took him just a week to make the moon and stars<br>
The sun and the earth and Jupiter and Mars<br>
How loving and patient He must be<br>
&lsquo;Cause He&rsquo;s still workin&rsquo; on me</p>
<p>There really ought to be a sign upon my heart<br>
Don&rsquo;t judge him yet, there&rsquo;s an unfinished part<br>
But I&rsquo;ll be better just according to His plan<br>
Fashioned by the Master&rsquo;s loving hands</p>
<p>In the mirror of His word<br>
Reflections that I see<br>
Makes me wonder why He never gave up on me<br>
But He loves me as I am and helps me when I pray<br>
Remember He&rsquo;s the potter, I&rsquo;m the clay</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s still working on me<br>
To make me what I need to be<br>
It took him just a week to make the moon and stars<br>
The sun and the earth and Jupiter and Mars<br>
How loving and patient He must be<br>
&lsquo;Cause He&rsquo;s still workin&rsquo; on me</p>
