I just live from day to day,
I don’t borrow from its sunshine,
For its skies may turn to grey,
I don’t worry over the future,
For I know what Jesus said,
That today He’ll walk beside me,
For He knows what is ahead. Many things about tomorrow
I don’t seem to understand
But I know who holds tomorrow
And I know who holds my hand." />

<li>I don’t know about tomorrow<br>
I just live from day to day,<br>
I don’t borrow from its sunshine,<br>
For its skies may turn to grey,<br>
I don’t worry over the future,<br>
For I know what Jesus said,<br>
That today He’ll walk beside me,<br>
For He knows what is ahead.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many things about tomorrow<br>
I don’t seem to understand<br>
But I know who holds tomorrow<br>
And I know who holds my hand.</p>
<p>I don’t know about tomorrow<br>
It may bring me poverty<br>
But the one who feeds the sparrow<br>
Is the one who stands by me<br>
And the path that is my portion<br>
May be through the flame or flood<br>
But His presence goes before me<br>
And I’m covered with His blood.</p>
<p>3)Every step is getting brighter<br>
As the golden stairs I climb;<br>
Every burden’s getting lighter,<br>
Every cloud is silver-lined.<br>
There the sun is always shining,<br>
There no tear will dim the eye;<br>
At the ending of the rainbow<br>
Where the mountains touch the sky.<br>
Many things about tomorrow<br>
I don’t seem to understand<br>
But I know who holds tomorrow<br>
And I know who holds my hand.</p>
