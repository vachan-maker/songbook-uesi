Keep Thou my feet, I do not ask to see
The distant scene; one step enough for me.

Should’st lead me on;
I loved to choose and see my path,

Lead Thou me on!" />

  <article><p>Lead, kindly Light,<br>
Amid the encircling gloom,<br>
Lead Thou me on!<br>
The night is dark, and I am far from home,<br>
Lead Thou me on!<br>
Keep Thou my feet, I do not ask to see<br>
The distant scene; one step enough for me.</p>
<p>I was not ever thus,<br>
nor prayed that Thou<br>
Should’st lead me on;<br>
I loved to choose and see my path,<br>
but now<br>
Lead Thou me on!<br>
I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,<br>
Pride ruled my will, remember not past years.</p>
<p>So long Thy power hath blest me,<br>
Sure it still, will lead me on,<br>
O’er moor and fen, o’er crag and<br>
torrent, till<br>
The night is gone,<br>
And with the morn, those angel<br>
faces smile,<br>
Which I have loved long since,<br>
and lost awhile</p>
