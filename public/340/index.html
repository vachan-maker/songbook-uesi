A million miles or more it feels today.
And though I haven’t lost my faith,
I must confess right now that it’s
Hard for me to pray.
But I don’t know what to say
And I don’t know where to start
But as you give the grace
With all that’s in my heart.
I will sing.
I will praise
Even in my darkest hour" />

  <article><p>Lord You seem so far away.<br>
A million miles or more it feels today.<br>
And though I haven’t lost my faith,<br>
I must confess right now that it’s<br>
Hard for me to pray.</p>
<p>But I don’t know what to say<br>
And I don’t know where to start<br>
But as you give the grace<br>
With all that’s in my heart.<br>
I will sing.<br>
I will praise<br>
Even in my darkest hour<br>
Through the sorrow and the pain.<br>
I will sing<br>
I will praise.<br>
Lift my hands to honor You<br>
Because Your word is true.<br>
I will sing.</p>
<p>Lord is hard for me to see<br>
All the thought and plan you have for me.<br>
But I will put my trust in you<br>
Knowing that you died to set me free.<br>
… (But I Don’t Know)</p>
