<meta property="og:description" content="When the music fades
All is stripped away,
And I simply come
Longing just to bring
Something that’s of worth
That will bless your heart
I’ll bring you more than a song,
For a song in itself
Is not what you have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You’re looking into my heart
I’m coming back to the heart of
worship
And it’s all about you," />

  <article><p>When the music fades<br>
All is stripped away,<br>
And I simply come<br>
Longing just to bring<br>
Something that’s of worth<br>
That will bless your heart</p>
<p>I’ll bring you more than a song,<br>
For a song in itself<br>
Is not what you have required<br>
You search much deeper within<br>
Through the way things appear<br>
You’re looking into my heart</p>
<p>I’m coming back to the heart of<br>
worship<br>
And it’s all about you,<br>
It’s all about You, Jesus<br>
I’m sorry, Lord, for the thing I’ve madeWhen it’s all about you,<br>
All about You, Jesus<br>
King of endless worth<br>
No one could express<br>
How much You deserve<br>
Though I’m weak and poor<br>
All I have is yours,<br>
Every single breath</p>
