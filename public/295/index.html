Manhood and deity,
In perfect harmony,
The man who is God,
Lord of eternity, dwells in humanity,
Kneels in humility and washes our feet.
Oh! What a mystery,
Meekness and majesty,
Bow down and worship,
For this is your God, this is your God.
Father’s pure radiance, perfect in
innocence,
Yet learns obedience, to death on a cross,
Suffering to give us life,
conquering through sacrifice,
And as they crucify, prays ‘Father forgive." />

Manhood and deity,<br>
In perfect harmony,<br>
The man who is God,<br>
Lord of eternity, dwells in humanity,<br>
Kneels in humility and washes our feet.</p>
<p>Oh! What a mystery,<br>
Meekness and majesty,</p>
<p>Bow down and worship,<br>
For this is your God, this is your God.<br>
Father’s pure radiance, perfect in<br>
innocence,<br>
Yet learns obedience, to death on a cross,<br>
Suffering to give us life,<br>
conquering through sacrifice,<br>
And as they crucify, prays ‘Father forgive.’</p>
<p>Wisdom unsearchable, God the invisible,<br>
Love indestructible, in frailty appears,<br>
Lord of infinity, stooping so tenderly,<br>
Lifts our humanity to the heights of His<br>
throne.</p>
