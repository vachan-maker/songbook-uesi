  <article><p>[verse 1] <br>
Father, I place into Your hands <br>
The things I cannot do. <br>
Father, I place into Your hands, <br>
The times that I’ve been through</p>
<p>[verse 2] <br>
Father, I place into Your hands, <br>
The way that I should go, <br>
For I know, I always can trust You. <br>
Father, I place into Your hands <br>
My friends and family.</p>
<p>[verse 3] <br>
Father, I place into Your hands, <br>
The things that trouble me. <br>
Father, I place into Your hands, <br>
The person I would be, <br>
For I know, I always can trust You.</p>
<p>[verse 4] <br>
Father, we love to seek Your face, <br>
We love to hear Your voice. <br>
Father, we love to sing Your praise, <br>
And in Your name rejoice. <br>
Father, we love to walk with you, <br>
And in Your presence rest, <br>
For we know we always can trust you.</p>
<p>[verse 5] <br>
Father, I want to be with you <br>
And do the things you do. <br>
Father, I want to speak the words <br>
That you are speaking, too. <br>
Father, I want to love the ones, <br>
That you will draw to you, <br>
For I know I am one you.</p>
