You’re the only one I need,
I turn to you and you are always there.
In troubled times it’s you I seek,
I put you first, that’s all I need,
I humble all I am, all to you.
One Way, Jesus!
You’re the only one that

You are always, always there,
Every how and everywhere,
Your grace abounds so deeply within me." />
