  <article><p>At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,<br>
And the burden of my heart rolled away,<br>
It was there by faith I received my sight,<br>
And now I am happy all the day!</p>
<p>At the Cross, that rugged Cross<br>
Where I lay my burdens down<br>
At the Cross that blood stained Cross<br>
The place where peace is found<br>
I’m gonna lay my burden down<br>
Was it for crimes that I had done<br>
He groaned upon the tree?</p>
<p>Amazing pity! grace unknown!<br>
And love beyond degree!</p>
<p>At the Cross, that rugged Cross<br>
Where I lay my burdens down<br>
At the Cross that blood stained Cross<br>
The place where peace is found<br>
I’m gonna lay my burden down</p>
<p>As I come before Your mercy I can hardly speak<br>
Surrounded by your glory and all Your majesty<br>
And I know that I’m not worthy<br>
Yet You give Your love to me<br>
And I am free - I am free</p>
<p>At the Cross, that rugged Cross<br>
Where I lay my burdens down<br>
At the Cross that blood stained Cross<br>
The place where peace is found<br>
I’m gonna lay my burden down</p>
