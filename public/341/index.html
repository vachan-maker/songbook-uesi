Let This Blest Assurance Control,
That Christ Hath Regarded My Helpless Estate,
And Hath Shed His Own Blood For My Soul." />

  <article><p>When Peace, Like A River, Attendeth My Way,<br>
When Sorrows Like Sea Billows Roll;<br>
Whatever My Lot, Thou Hast Taught Me To Say,<br>
It Is Well, It Is Well With My Soul.</p>
<p>It Is Well With My Soul,<br>
It Is Well, It Is Well With My Soul.</p>
<p>Though Satan Should Buffet, Though Trials Should Come,<br>
Let This Blest Assurance Control,<br>
That Christ Hath Regarded My Helpless Estate,<br>
And Hath Shed His Own Blood For My Soul.</p>
<p>It Is Well With My Soul,<br>
It Is Well, It Is Well With My Soul.</p>
<p>My Sin—Oh, The Bliss Of This Glorious Thought!—<br>
My Sin, Not In Part But The Whole,<br>
Is Nailed To The Cross, And I Bear It No More,<br>
Praise The Lord, Praise The Lord, O My Soul!</p>
<p>It Is Well With My Soul,<br>
It Is Well, It Is Well With My Soul.</p>
<p>For Me, Be It Christ, Be It Christ Hence To Live:<br>
If Jordan Above Me Shall Roll,<br>
No Pang Shall Be Mine, For In Death As In Life<br>
Thou Wilt Whisper Thy Peace To My Soul.</p>
<p>It Is Well With My Soul,<br>
It Is Well, It Is Well With My Soul.</p>
<p>But, Lord, ’Tis For Thee, For Thy Coming We Wait,<br>
The Sky, Not The Grave, Is Our Goal;<br>
Oh, Trump Of The Angel! Oh, Voice Of The Lord!<br>
Blessed Hope, Blessed Rest Of My Soul!</p>
<p>It Is Well With My Soul,<br>
It Is Well, It Is Well With My Soul.</p>
<p>And Lord, Haste The Day When The Faith Shall Be Sight,<br>
The Clouds Be Rolled Back As A Scroll;<br>
The Trump Shall Resound, And The Lord Shall Descend,<br>
Even So, It Is Well With My Soul.</p>
<p>It Is Well With My Soul,<br>
It Is Well, It Is Well With My Soul.</p>
