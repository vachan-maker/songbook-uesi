<h3>345. In Christ Alone</h3>
<p>Stuart Townend and Keith Getty</p>
<p>Key: </p>
  <article><p>In Christ alone my hope is found<br>
He is my light, my strength, my song<br>
This cornerstone, this solid ground,<br>
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.<br>
What heights of love, what depths of peace,<br>
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!<br>
My comforter, my all in all<br>
Here in the love of Christ I stand.</p>
<p>In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,<br>
Fullness of God in helpless babe!<br>
This gift of love and righteousness,<br>
Scorned by the ones He came to save.<br>
&lsquo;Til on that cross as Jesus died,<br>
The wrath of God was satisfied<br>
For ev&rsquo;ry sin on Him was laid<br>
Here in the death of Christ I live.</p>
<p>There in the ground His body lay,<br>
Light of the world by darkness slain<br>
Then bursting forth in glorious day,<br>
Up from the grave He rose again!<br>
And as He stands in victory,<br>
Sin&rsquo;s curse has lost its grip on me<br>
For I am His and He is mine<br>
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.</p>
<p>No guilt in life, no fear in death<br>
This is the pow&rsquo;r of Christ in me<br>
From life&rsquo;s first cry to final breath,<br>
Jesus commands my destiny.<br>
No pow&rsquo;r of hell, no scheme of man,<br>
Can ever pluck me from His hand<br>
&lsquo;Til He returns or calls me home<br>
Here in the pow&rsquo;r of Christ I&rsquo;ll stand.</p>
