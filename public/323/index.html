With many a conflict, many a doubt," />

  <article><p>Just as I am, without one plea,<br>
But that Thy blood was shed for me,<br>
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</p>
<p>Just as I am, and waiting not<br>
To rid my soul of one dark blot,<br>
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</p>
<p>Just as I am, though tossed about<br>
With many a conflict, many a doubt,<br>
Fightings and fears within, without,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</p>
<p>Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;<br>
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,<br>
Yea, all I need in Thee to find,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</p>
<p>Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,<br>
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;<br>
Because Thy promise I believe,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</p>
<p>Just as I am, Thy love unknown<br>
Hath broken every barrier down;<br>
Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</p>
<p>Just as I am, of that free love<br>
The breadth, length, depth, and height to prove,<br>
Here for a season, then above,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!</p>
