So my soul longeth after You,
You alone are my heart’s desire,
And I long to worship you.
You alone are my strength my shield,
To You alone may my spirit yield,
You alone are my heart’s desire,
And I long to worship You.
I want You more than gold or silver, only
You can satisfy,
You alone are the real joy giver," />
