Welcome to the family,  
weâ€™re glad that you have come  
To share your life with us, as we grow in love and  
May we always be to you, what God would have us be  
A family always there, to be strong and to lean on  
  
May we learn to love each other, more  
with each new day  
May words of love be on our lips in  
everything we say  
May the Spirit melt our hearts and  
teach us how to pray  
That we might be a true family
