God is good all the time  
He put a song of praise,  
In this heart of mine,  
God is good all the time,  
Through the darkest night,  
His light will shine, God is good,  
God is good, all the time!  
  
If you’re walking through the valley,  
There are shadows all around;  
Do not fear, He will guide you,  
He will keep you safe and sound,  
He has promised, to never leave you,  
Nor forsake you and His word is true.  
  
We were sinners, so unworthy,  
Still for us He chose to die,  
He filled us with His Holy Spirit,  
Now we can stand and testify,  
That His love is everlasting,  
And His mercies, they will never end.  
  
Though I may not understand,  
All the plans you’ve made for me,  
My life is in your hands,  
And through the eyes of faith,  
I can clearly see.
