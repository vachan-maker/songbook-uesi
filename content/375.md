This is the air I breathe  
This is the air I breathe  
Your holy presence  
Living in me  

This is my daily bread  
This is my daily bread  
Your very word  
Spoken to me  

And I... I’m desperate for you  
And I... I’m lost without you  

This is air I breath  
This is air I breathe  
Your holy presence  
Living in me  

And I... I’m desparate for you  
And I... I’m lost without you (eh hey, yeah)  
And I... I’m desparate for you  
And I... I’m lost without you  

And I... I’m desparate for you  
And I... I’m lost without you  
I’m lost without you  
I’m lost without you  
I’m lost without you (father)  
I’m lost, .without you  

This is the air I breathe  
This is the air I breathe
