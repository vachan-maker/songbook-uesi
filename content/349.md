title: 'Your Love is Amazing'
---
Your love is amazing,  
Steady and unchanging  
Your love is a mountain,  
Firm beneath my feet  
Your love is a mystery,  
how you gently lift me  
When I am surrounded, your love carries me  

Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Hallelujah, your love makes me sing  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Hallelujah, your love makes me sing  

Your love is surprising,  
I can feel it rising  
All the joy thatâ€™s growing deep inside of me  
Every time I see you,  
All your goodness shines through  
And I can feel this God song,  
rising up in me  
Yes, You make me sing  
Lord, You make me sing, sing, sing  
How You make me sing
