I need Thee every hour,  
most gracious Lord;  
No tender voice like Thine can peace afford.  
  
I need Thee, oh, I need Thee;  
Every hour I need Thee;  
Oh, bless me now, my Savior,  
I come to Thee.  
  
I need Thee every hour,  
stay Thou nearby;  
Temptations lose their powâ€™r when  
Thou art nigh.  
  
I need Thee every hour, in joy or pain;  
Come quickly and abide, or life is vain  
  
I need Thee every hour; teach me Thy will;  
And Thy rich promises in me fulfill.  
  
I need Thee every hour, most Holy One;  
Oh, make me Thine indeed, Thou blessed Son.
