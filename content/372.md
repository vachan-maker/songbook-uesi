At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,  
And the burden of my heart rolled away,  
It was there by faith I received my sight,  
And now I am happy all the day!  
  
At the Cross, that rugged Cross  
Where I lay my burdens down  
At the Cross that blood stained Cross  
The place where peace is found  
I’m gonna lay my burden down  
Was it for crimes that I had done  
He groaned upon the tree?  
  
Amazing pity! grace unknown!  
And love beyond degree!  
  
At the Cross, that rugged Cross  
Where I lay my burdens down  
At the Cross that blood stained Cross  
The place where peace is found  
I’m gonna lay my burden down  
  
As I come before Your mercy I can hardly speak  
Surrounded by your glory and all Your majesty  
And I know that I’m not worthy  
Yet You give Your love to me  
And I am free - I am free  
  
At the Cross, that rugged Cross  
Where I lay my burdens down  
At the Cross that blood stained Cross  
The place where peace is found  
I’m gonna lay my burden down
