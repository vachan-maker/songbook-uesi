1. All to Jesus I surrender  
All to Him I freely give,  
I will ever love and trust Him,  
In His presence daily live.  
  
I surrender all (2)  
All to thee my blessed Saviour,  
I surrender all  
  
2. All to Jesus I surrender,  
Humbly at His feet I bow,  
Worldly pleasures all forsaken,  
Take me Jesus, take me now  
  
3. All to Jesus I surrender,  
Make me Saviour wholly Thine,  
Let me feel the Holy Spirit,  
Truly know that Thou art mine.  
  
4. All to Jesus I surrender,  
Lord I give myself to Thee  
Fill me with Thy love and power,  
Let Thy blessings fall on me  
  
5. All to Jesus I surrender,  
Now I feel the sacred flame.  
Oh, the joy of full salvation!  
Glory, glory to His name!
