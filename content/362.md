[verse 1]  
Unto Thee, Oh Lord  
Do I lift up my soul, (2)  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh! My God, I trust in Thee,  
Let me not be ashamed,  
Let not my enemies triumph over me  
  
[verse 2]  
Show me Thy ways, Thy ways Oh Lord! (2)  
Teach me Thy paths, Thy paths Oh Lord! (2)  
Let none that wait, on Thee be ashamed. (2)
