Where there seems to be no way,  
He works in ways we cannot see,  
He will make a way for me  
He will be my guide,  
Hold me closely to His side,  
With love and strength for each new day,  
He will make a way. (2)  
  
By a road way in the wilderness,  
He will lead me,  
And rivers in the desert will I see,  
Heaven and earth will fade,  
But His word will still remain,  
He will do something new today.
