John 12:32
We want to see Jesus lifted high  
The banner that flies across this land,  
That all men might see the truth and know,  
He is the way to heaven  
  
  
We wanna see, (3) Jesus lifted high,  
  
  
Step by step we’re moving forward,  
Little by little we’re taking ground,  
Every prayer is a powerful weapon,  
Strongholds come tumbling, down and  
Down and down and down.
