In the stars His handiwork I see,  
On the winds He speaks of majesty  
Though He ruleth over land and sea  
What is that to me?  
I will celebrate Nativity,  
For it has its place in history  
Sure, He came to set His people free  
What is that to me?  
  
Till one day I met Him face to face  
And I felt the wonder of His grace,  
Then I knew that He was more than just a  
God who didn’t care,  
That lived a way out there, and  
  
Now He walks beside me day by day  
Ever watching o’er me lest I stray  
Helping me to find that narrow way  
He’s everything to me
