[verse 1]    
Father, I place into Your hands    
The things I cannot do.    
Father, I place into Your hands,    
The times that Iâ€™ve been through    
    
[verse 2]    
Father, I place into Your hands,    
The way that I should go,    
For I know, I always can trust You.    
Father, I place into Your hands    
My friends and family.    
    
[verse 3]    
Father, I place into Your hands,    
The things that trouble me.    
Father, I place into Your hands,    
The person I would be,    
For I know, I always can trust You.    
    
[verse 4]    
Father, we love to seek Your face,    
We love to hear Your voice.    
Father, we love to sing Your praise,    
And in Your name rejoice.    
Father, we love to walk with you,    
And in Your presence rest,    
For we know we always can trust you.    
    
[verse 5]    
Father, I want to be with you    
And do the things you do.    
Father, I want to speak the words    
That you are speaking, too.    
Father, I want to love the ones,    
That you will draw to you,    
For I know I am one you.
