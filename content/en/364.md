God forgave my sin in Jesus’ name,  
I’ve been born again in Jesus’ name;  
And in Jesus’ name I come to you,  
To share His love as He told me to.  
  
He said: ‘Freely, freely, you have received,  
Freely, freely give;  
Go in My name, and because you believe,  
Others will know that I live.’  
  
All power is given in Jesus’ name,  
In earth and heaven in Jesus’ name;  
And in Jesus’ name I come to you  
To share His power as He told me to.
