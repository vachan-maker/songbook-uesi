Peace on earth, and mercy mild,  
God and sinners reconciled.  
Joyful, all ye nations rise,  
Join the triumph of the skies;  
With the angelic host proclaim,  
‘Christ is born in Bethlehem!’  
Hark! The herald – angels sing  
‘Glory to the new-born King!’  
Christ by highest heav’n adored,  
Christ, the everlasting Lord,  
Late in time, behold Him come,  
Offspring of the virgin’s womb!  
Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see!  
Hail, the ‘incarnate Deity!  
Pleased as man with men to dwell,  
Jesus, our Immanuel.  
Hail, the heav’n-born Prince of Peace  
Hail, the Son of righteousness!  
Light and life to all He brings,  
Ris’n with healing in His wings.  
Mild He lays His glory by,  
Born that, man no more may die;  
Born to raise the son of earth,  
Born to give them second birth.
