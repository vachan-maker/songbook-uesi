Psalms 100:5;Hebrews 4:16  
God is good! We sing and shout it,  
God is good! We celebrate,  
God is good! No more we doubt it,  
God is good! We know itâ€™s true.  
And when I think of His love for me,  
My heart fills with praise  
And I feel like dancing,  
For in His heart there is room for me,  
And I run with arms open wide
