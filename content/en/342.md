Even though I walk through the valley  
Of the shadow of death  
Your perfect love is casting out fear  
  
And even when I'm caught in the middle  
Of the storms of this life  
I won't turn back, I know You are near  
  
And I will fear no evil  
For my God is with me  
And if my God is with me  
Whom then shall I fear?  
Whom then shall I fear?  
  
Oh no, You never let go  
Through the calm and through the storm  
Oh no, You never let go  
In every high and every low  
Oh no, You never let go  
Lord, You never let go of me  
  
And I can see a light that is coming  
For the heart that holds on  
A glorious light beyond all compare  
  
And there will be an end to these troubles  
But until that day comes  
We'll live to know You here on the earth  
  
And I will fear no evil  
For my God is with me  
And if my God is with me  
Whom then shall I fear?  
Whom then shall I fear?  
  
Oh no, You never let go  
Through the calm and through the storm  
Oh no, You never let go  
In every high and every low  
Oh no, You never let go  
Lord, You never let go of me  
  
Yes, I can see a light that is coming  
For the heart that holds on  
And there will be an end to these troubles  
But until that day comes  
Still I will praise You  
Still I will praise You  
  
Yes, I can see a light that is coming  
For the heart that holds on  
And there will be an end to these troubles  
But until that day comes  
Still I will praise You  
Still I will praise You  
  
Oh no, You never let go  
Through the calm and through the storm  
Oh no, You never let go  
In every high and every low  
Oh no, You never let go  
Lord, You never let go of me  
Oh, You never let go  
You never let go  
  
Oh no, You never let go  
Through the calm and through the storm  
Oh no, You never let go  
In every high and every low  
Oh no, You never let go  
Lord, You never let go of me  
  
You never let, You never let go  
You never let go of me
