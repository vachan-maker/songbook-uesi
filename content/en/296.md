We are here to praise You, Lift our  
hearts and sing;  
We are here to give You,  
The best that we can bring.  
And it is our love, rising from our hearts,  
Everything within us cries, “Abba Father”  
Help us now to give You, Pleasure and  
delight,  
Heart and mind and will that say,  
“I love You Lord “
