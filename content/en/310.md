I love You, Lord, And I lift my voice,  
To worship You, Oh! My soul, rejoice!  
Take joy, my King, in what You hear,  
Let it be a sweet, sweet sound in Your ear.  
I love you, Lord, and I lift my hands  
To worship you as my soul demands  
Take joy, my King, in what you see  
May I be a sweet, sweet child on your knee
