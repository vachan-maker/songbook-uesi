---  
Are you tired of chasing pretty  
rainbows?  
And are you tired of spinning ‘round  
and ‘round?  
Wrap up all the shattered dreams of  
your life  
And at the feet of Jesus lay them down  
  
Give them all, give them all, give them  
all to Jesus  
Shattered dreams, wounded hearts  
and broken toys  
Give them all, give them all, give them  
all to Jesus  
And He will turn your sorrow into joy  
He never said, you’d only see sunshine  
He never said, there’d be no rain  
He only promised a heart full of singing  
About the very things that once  
brought pain  
And He will turn your sorrow into joy
