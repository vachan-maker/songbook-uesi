Over the mountains and the sea  
Your river runs with love for me  
And I will open up my heart  
And let the Healer set me free  
I’m happy to be in the truth  
And I will daily lift my hands  
For I will always sing  
Of when Your love came down  

[Chorus]  
I could sing of your love forever  
I could sing of your love forever  
(Over the...)  
  
Oh, I feel like dancing  
It’s foolishness I know  
But when the world has seen the Light  
They will dance with joy like we’re dancing now
