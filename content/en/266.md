Father in heaven, how we love you.  
We lift your Name in all the earth.  
May your kingdom, be established in  
our praises,  
As your people declare your mighty  
works.  
Blessed be the Lord God Almighty  
Who was and is, and is, to come.  
Blessed be the Lord God Almighty.  
Who reigns forever more.
