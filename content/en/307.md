Come on and celebrate  
His gift of love, we will celebrate,  
The Son of God who loved us,  
And gave us life.  

We’ll shout Your praise, Oh! King,  
You give us joy nothing else can bring,  
We’ll give to You our offering,  
In celebration praise.  
Come on and celebrate, celebrate,  
Celebrate and sing,  
Celebrate and sing to the King. (2)
