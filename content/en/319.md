I will sing of the mercies of the Lord  
Forever I will sing, I will sing.  
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord,  
Forever I will sing of the mercies of the  
Lord.  
With my mouth will I make known,  
Thy faithfulness, Thy faithfulness.  
With my mouth will I make known,  
Thy faithfulness to all generations.
