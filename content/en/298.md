John 14:23  
Father God, I wonder how I managed  
to exist  
Without the knowledge of your  
parenthood,  
And Your loving care,  
But now I am Your child, I am adopted in  
Your family,  
And I will never be alone,  
‘Cause Father God, You’re there  
beside me.  
I will sing Your praises (3) Forever more.
