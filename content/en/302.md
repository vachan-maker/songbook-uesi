Revelation 7:10  
Salvation belongs to our God  
Who sits upon the throne,  
And unto the Lamb,  
Be Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks,  
Honour and power and strength.  
Be to our God, forever and ever, (2)  
Amen!  
We, the redeemed shall be strong,  
In purpose and unity,  
Declaring aloud,  
Be Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks,  
Honour and power and strength.
