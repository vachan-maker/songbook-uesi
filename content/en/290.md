Psalms 19:1  
All heavens declare, the glory of the  
risen Lord  
Who can compare with the beauty  
of the risen Lord  
Forever, He will be, the Lamb upon the  
throne,  
I gladly bow my knee and worship Him  
alone.  
I will proclaim the glory of the risen Lord,  
Who once was slain to reconcile man  
to God  
Forever, you will be, the Lamb upon  
the throne,  
I gladly bow my knee and worship you  
alone.
