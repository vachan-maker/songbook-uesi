Psalms 138:2  
When I look into your holiness  
When I gaze into your loveliness  
When all things that surround me  
Become shadows in the light of you,  
When Iâ€™ve found the joy of reaching  
your heart,  
When my will becomes enthroned in  
your love,  
When all things that surround me  
Become shadows in the light of you.  
I worship you (2)  
The reason I live, is to worship you (2)  
(Wayne & Cathy Perrin)
