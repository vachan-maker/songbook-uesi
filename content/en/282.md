Our confidence is in the Lord  
The source of our salvation  
Rest is found in Him alone  
The Author of creation  
We will not fear the evil day  
Because we have a refuge  
In every circumstance we say  
Our hope is built on Jesus  
He is our fortress  

We will never be shaken  
He is our fortress  
We will never be shaken  
We will put our trust in God  
We will put our trust in God
