title: 'I Know He Rescued my Soul'
---
I know He rescued my soul  
His blood has covered my sin,  
I believe! I believe!  
My shame He’s taken away  
My pain is healed in His name  
I believe! I believe!  
I’ll raise a banner,  
‘Cause my Lord has conquered the  
grave  

My Redeemer lives, My Redeemer lives,  
My Redeemer lives, My Redeemer lives.  

You lift my burdens  
I’ll rise with you,  
I’m dancing on this mountain top,  
To see your kingdom come
