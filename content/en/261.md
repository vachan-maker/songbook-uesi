Everyone needs compassion,  
A love that’s never failing,  
Let mercy fall on me  
Everyone needs forgiveness,  
Kindness of the Savior  
The Hope of nations  

Savior, He can move the mountains,  
My God is mighty to save,  
He is mighty to save  
Forever, author of salvation,  
He rose and conquered the grave  
Jesus conquered the grave 

 
So take me as you find me  
All my fears and failures  
Fill my life again  
I give my life to follow  
Everything I believe in  
Now I surrender  
Yes, I surrender  


Shine a light and let the whole world see  
We’re singing, for the glory of the risen  
king Jesus,  
 (Savior, He can)  
Shine a light and let the whole world see  
Singing for the glory of the risen king  
(Savior, He can)
