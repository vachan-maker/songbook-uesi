I am not skilled to understand  
What God has willed, what God has  
planned  
I only know at His right hand  
Stands one who is my Saviour  
I take Him at His word and deed  
Christ died to save me; this I read  
And in my heart I find a need  
Of Him to be my savior  
That He would leave His place on high  
And come for sinful man to die  
  
You count it strange, so once did I  
Before I met my Saviour  
My Saviour loves, My Saviour lives  
My Saviourâ€™s always there for me  
My God: He was, my God; He is  
My God is always gonna be  
 (2)  
Yes, living, dying, let me bring  
My strength, my solace from this spring;  
That He who lives to be my King  
Once died to be my Saviour  
That He would leave His place on high  
And come for sinful man to die  
You count it strange, so once did I  
Before I knew my Saviour
