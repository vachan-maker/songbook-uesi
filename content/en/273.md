Thank you for the cross Lord  
Thank you for the price You paid  
Bearing all my sin and shame  
In love you came  
And gave amazing grace  
Thank you for this love Lord  
Thank you for your nail pierced hands  
Washed me in your cleansing flow  
Now all I know  
Your forgiveness and embrace  
  
Worthy is the Lamb  
Seated on the throne  
Crown you now with many crowns  
You reign victorious  
High and lifted up  
Jesus Son of God  
The Darling of Heaven crucified  
Worthy is the Lamb  
Worthy is the Lamb Hillsong
