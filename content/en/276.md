With our hearts we believe  
With our mouths we confess  
You are Lord, You are Lord;  
From this day till the end  
We will sing it again and again  
You are Lord, You are Lord.

(2)  
  
By Your power you’ve made us,  
And by Your grace we’re redeemed,  
To walk in the truth  
That you give us,  
And minister life in your name  
In your name.
