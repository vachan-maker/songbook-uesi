Here and now, here in this moment  
Here and now I turn to you  
All that my searching heart has longed  
for can be found  


‘Cause you’re in this moment,  
here and now  
What majesty, what mystery,  
The God of all eternity  
Stepped into time and gave His life for me  

  
Your hand is seen in galaxies,  
Yet Your Spirit dwells in me  
So vast and yet you’re still within our reach

  
There is nowhere you can’t be found  
Nothing on earth could ever keep Your Presence out  


Here and now, here in this moment  
Here and now I turn to you  
All that my searching heart has longed for can be found  
‘Cause you’re in this moment, here  
and now  
You’re in this moment here and now
