Lord I stand in the midst of a multitude  
Of those from every tribe and tongue  
We are your people redeemed by  
your blood  
  
  
Rescued from death by your love  
There are no words  
Good enough to thank You  
There are no words to express my praise  
But I will lift up my voice  
And sing from my heart  
With all of my strength  
  
  
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah  
To the Lamb  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
By the blood of Christ we stand  
Every tongue every tribe  
Every people every land  
Giving glory giving honor  
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God  
  
  
Lord we stand by grace in your presence  
Cleansed by the blood of the Lamb  
We are your children called by your name  
Humbly we bow and we pray  
Release your power  
To work in us and through us  
Till we are changed  
To be more like you  
Then all the nations will see  
Your glory revealed  
And worship you
