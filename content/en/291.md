As the deer panteth for the water  
So my soul longeth after You,  
You alone are my heart’s desire,  
And I long to worship you.  
  
  
You alone are my strength my shield,  
To You alone may my spirit yield,  
You alone are my heart’s desire,  
And I long to worship You.  
  
  
I want You more than gold or silver, only  
You can satisfy,  
You alone are the real joy giver,  
And the apple of my eye  
  
You’re my friend and You are my brother,  
Even though You are my King,  
I love You more than any other,  
So much more than anything.
