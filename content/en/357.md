We believe in God, the Father  
Maker of the universe,  
And in Christ, the Son, our Saviour,  
Come to us by virgin birth,  
We believe He died to save us,  
Bore our sins, was crucified;  
Then from death, He rose victorious,  
Ascended to the Father’s side.  
  
Jesus, Lord of all… Lord of all (4)  
Name above all names (2)  
  
We believe He sends His Spirit,  
On His church with gifts of power,  
God, His word of truth affirming,  
Sends us to the nations now,  
He will come again in glory,  
Judge the living and the dead,  
Every knee shall bow before Him,  
Then must every tongue confess
