title: 'Who Am I, that the Lord of All the Earth'
songno: 322
---  
Who Am I, that the Lord of all the earth  
Would care to know my name  
Who am I, that the bright and morning stars  
Would choose to light the way  
For my ever wandering heart  
Not because of who I am  
But because of what you’ve done  
Not because of what I’ve done  
But because of who You are  
  
Chorus:  
I am a flower quickly fading  
Here today and gone tomorrow  
A wave tossed in the ocean  
A vapor in the wind  
Still You hear me when I’m calling  
Lord, You catch me when I’m falling  
And you’ve told me who I am  
I am Yours, I am yours  
  
Who am I, that the eyes that see my sin  
Would look on me with love and  
watch me rise again.  
Who am I, that the Voice that calmed the sea  
Would call out through the rain  
And calm the storm in me  
not because of who I am  
but because of what You done  
not because of what I done  
but because of who you are
