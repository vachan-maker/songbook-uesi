Lord You seem so far away.   
A million miles or more it feels today.  
And though I haven’t lost my faith,  
I must confess right now that it’s  
Hard for me to pray.  
  
But I don’t know what to say  
And I don’t know where to start  
But as you give the grace  
With all that’s in my heart.  
I will sing.  
I will praise  
Even in my darkest hour  
Through the sorrow and the pain.  
I will sing  
I will praise.  
Lift my hands to honor You  
Because Your word is true.  
I will sing.  
  
Lord is hard for me to see  
All the thought and plan you have for me.  
But I will put my trust in you  
Knowing that you died to set me free.  
… (But I Don’t Know)
