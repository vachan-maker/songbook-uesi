He's still working on me  
To make me what I need to be  
It took him just a week to make the moon and stars  
The sun and the earth and Jupiter and Mars  
How loving and patient He must be  
'Cause He's still workin' on me  
  
There really ought to be a sign upon my heart  
Don't judge him yet, there's an unfinished part  
But I'll be better just according to His plan  
Fashioned by the Master's loving hands  
  
In the mirror of His word  
Reflections that I see  
Makes me wonder why He never gave up on me  
But He loves me as I am and helps me when I pray  
Remember He's the potter, I'm the clay  
  
He's still working on me  
To make me what I need to be  
It took him just a week to make the moon and stars  
The sun and the earth and Jupiter and Mars  
How loving and patient He must be  
'Cause He's still workin' on me
