Down the mountain the river flows  
And it brings refreshing wherever it goes  
Through the valleys and over the fields  
The river is rushing and the river is here  
  
  
The river of God sets my feet a- dancing  
The river of God fills our hearts with cheer  
The river of God fills our mouths with laughter  
And we rejoice for the river is here  
  
The river of God is teeming with life  
And all who touch it can be revived  
Those who linger on this riverâ€™s shore  
Will come back thirsting for more of the Lord  
  
  
Up the mountain, we love to go  
To find the presence of the Lord  
Along the banks of the river we run  
We dance with laughter giving praise  
to the Son
