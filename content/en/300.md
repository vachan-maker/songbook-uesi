Hail Jesus, You’re My King,  
Your Life Frees Me To Sing,  
I Will Praise You All My Days,  
You’re Perfect In All Your Ways.  
  
Hail Jesus, You’re My Lord,  
I Will Obey Your Word,  
I Want To See Your Kingdom Come,  
Not My Will But Yours Be Done.  
  
Glory, Glory To The Lamb,  
You Take Me Into The Land,  
We Will Conquer In Your Name,  
And Proclaim That Jesus Reigns.  
  
Hail, Hail Lion Of Judah,  
How Powerful You Are,  
Hail, Hail Lion Of Judah,  
How Wonderful You Are, How Wonderful You Are
