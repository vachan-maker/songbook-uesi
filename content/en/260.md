As we lift up our hands  
Will you meet us here?  
As we call on your name  
Will you meet us here?  
We have coâ€™me to this place  
To worship you  
God of mercy and grace  
It is you, we adore  
It is you, praises are for  
Only you, the heavens declare  
It is you; it is you  
Holy, holy is our God Almighty  
Holy, holy is His name alone  
Holy, holy is our God Almighty  
Holy, holy is His name alone
