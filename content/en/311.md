Majesty! Worship His majesty  
Unto Jesus, be all glory, power and praise.  
Majesty! Kingdom authority,  
Flows from His throne,  
Unto His own, His anthem raise.  
  
So exalt, Lift up on high,  
The name of Jesus,  
Magnify, come glorify,  
Christ Jesus, the King!  
Majesty, worship His majesty,  
Jesus who died, now glorified,  
King of all kings.
