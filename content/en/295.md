Meekness and majesty,  
Manhood and deity,  
In perfect harmony,  
The man who is God,  
Lord of eternity, dwells in humanity,  
Kneels in humility and washes our feet.  
  
Oh! What a mystery,  
Meekness and majesty,  
  
Bow down and worship,  
For this is your God, this is your God.  
Father’s pure radiance, perfect in  
innocence,  
Yet learns obedience, to death on a cross,  
Suffering to give us life,  
conquering through sacrifice,  
And as they crucify, prays ‘Father forgive.’  
  
Wisdom unsearchable, God the invisible,  
Love indestructible, in frailty appears,  
Lord of infinity, stooping so tenderly,  
Lifts our humanity to the heights of His  
throne.
