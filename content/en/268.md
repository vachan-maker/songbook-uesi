I just want to praise You,    
Lift my hands and say, “I love You.”    
You are everything to me    
And I exalt Your holy name on high.    
I just want to praise You,    
Lift my hands and say, “I love You.”    
You are everything to me    
And I exalt Your holy name,    
I exalt Your holy name,    
I exalt Your holy name,    
On high.
