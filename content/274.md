The Lord reigns  
The Lord reigns  
The Lord reigns  
Let the earth rejoice  
Let the earth rejoice  
Let the earth rejoice  
Let the people be glad  
That our God reigns  
A fire goes before Him  
And burns up all His enemies  
The hills melt like wax  
At the presence of the Lord  
At the presence of the Lord  
The heavens declare  
His righteousness  
The people see His glory  
For You O Lord are exalted  
Over all the earth  
Over all the earth  
Our God reigns Our God reigns
