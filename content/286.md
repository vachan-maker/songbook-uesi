Mercy is falling, is falling, is falling.  
Mercy, it falls like a sweet spring rain.  
Mercy is falling is falling all over me.  
Mercy is falling, is falling, is falling.  
Mercy, it falls like a sweet spring rain.  
Mercy is falling is falling all over me.  
Hey-yo, I received your mercy.  
Hey-yo, I received your grace.  
Hey-yo, I will dance forevermore.
