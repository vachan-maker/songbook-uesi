To God be the glory! Great things He  
has done,  
So loved He the world that He gave us  
His Son,  
Who yielded His life,  
an atonement for sin,  
And opened the life-gate that all may  
go in  
  
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!   
Let the earth hear His voice.  
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!    
Let the people rejoice.  
Oh! Come to the Father through Jesus,    
the Son,  
And give Him the glory, great things  
He has done.  

Oh! Perfect redemption, the purchase  
of blood,  
To every believer, the promise of God,  
The vilest offender who truly believes,  
That moment from Jesus a pardon  
receives.  
Great things He has taught us,  
Great things He has done,  
And great our rejoicing through Jesus,  
the Son.  
But purer and higher and greater will be,  
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus  
we see!
