1 Take my life and let it be  
consecrated, Lord, to thee.  
Take my moments and my days;  
let them flow in endless praise,  
let them flow in endless praise.  
  
2 Take my hands and let them move  
at the impulse of thy love.  
Take my feet and let them be  
swift and beautiful for thee,  
swift and beautiful for thee.  
  
3 Take my voice and let me sing  
always, only, for my King.  
Take my lips and let them be  
filled with messages from thee,  
filled with messages from thee.  
  
4 Take my silver and my gold;  
not a mite would I withhold.  
Take my intellect and use  
every power as thou shalt choose,  
every power as thou shalt choose.  
  
5 Take my will and make it thine;  
it shall be no longer mine.  
Take my heart it is thine own;  
it shall be thy royal throne,  
it shall be thy royal throne.  
  
6 Take my love; my Lord, I pour  
at thy feet its treasure store.  
Take myself, and I will be  
ever, only, all for thee,  
ever, only, all for thee.
