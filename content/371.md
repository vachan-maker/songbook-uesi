[verse 1]  
Alas, and did my Savior bleed?  
And did my Sovereign die?  
Would He devote that sacred head  
For sinners such as I ?  
  
[verse 2]  
Was it for crimes that I had done,  
He groaned upon the tree?  
Amazing pity! Grace unknown!  
And love beyond degree!  
  
[verse 3]  
Well might the sun in darkness hide,  
And shut its glories in,  
When God, the mighty maker died  
For His the creature’s sin.  
  
[verse 4]  
But drops of grief can ne’er repay  
The debt of love I owe  
Here, Lord, I give myself away  
Tis all that I can do.
