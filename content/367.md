You are my refuge,  
You are my fortress,  
You are my friend in need,  
You are my God

[Chorus]    
I will worship you with all of my heart,  
I will seek your face all through my life,  
I will serve You, Lord, all that I am,  
Here I am,  
Here I am, Oh Lord! (3)  
Here I am  
  
[verse 2]  
You are my Saviour,  
You are my healer,  
You are my strength in need,  
You are my God,  
You are my Shepherd,  
You are my comfort  
You are my hiding place,  
You are my God.
