Thank You Jesus,  
Thank You Jesus,  
Thank You Lord, for loving me,  
Thank You Jesus, thank You, Jesus,  
Thank You Lord, for loving me.  
  
You went to Calvary,  
And there You died for me,  
Thank You, Lord, for loving me, (2)  
  
You rose up from the grave,  
To me new life You gave,  
Thank You, Lord, for loving me. (2
