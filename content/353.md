title: 'I dont know about tomorrow'
---
1) I don’t know about tomorrow  
I just live from day to day,  
I don’t borrow from its sunshine,  
For its skies may turn to grey,  
I don’t worry over the future,  
For I know what Jesus said,  
That today He’ll walk beside me,  
For He knows what is ahead.  
  
Many things about tomorrow  
I don’t seem to understand  
But I know who holds tomorrow  
And I know who holds my hand.  
  
I don’t know about tomorrow  
It may bring me poverty  
But the one who feeds the sparrow  
Is the one who stands by me  
And the path that is my portion  
May be through the flame or flood  
But His presence goes before me  
And I’m covered with His blood.  
  
3)Every step is getting brighter  
As the golden stairs I climb;  
Every burden’s getting lighter,  
Every cloud is silver-lined.  
There the sun is always shining,  
There no tear will dim the eye;  
At the ending of the rainbow  
Where the mountains touch the sky.  
Many things about tomorrow  
I don’t seem to understand  
But I know who holds tomorrow  
And I know who holds my hand.
