Blessed Be Your Name    
In the land that is plentiful    
Where your streams of abundance flow    
Blessed be your name    
  
Blessed be your name    
When I’m found in the desert place    
Though I walk through the wilderness    
Blessed be your name    
  
Every blessing you pour out    
I’ll turn back to praise    
When the darkness closes in, Lord    
Still I will say    
    
Blessed be the name of the Lord    
Blessed be your name    
Blessed be the name of the Lord    
Blessed be your glorious name    
Blessed be your name    
    
    
When the sun’s shining down on me    
When the world’s ‘all as it should be’    
Blessed be your name    
Blessed be your name    
  
On the road marked with suffering    
Though there’s pain in the offering    
Blessed be your name    
  
Every blessing You pour out    
I’ll turn back to praise    
When the darkness closes in, Lord    
Still I will say    
Blessed be the...    
  
You give and take away  
You give and take away  
My heart will choose to say  
Lord, blessed be Your name  
You give and take away  
You give and take away  
My heart will choose to say  
Lord, blessed be Your name  
You give and take away  
You give and take away  
My heart will choose to say  
Lord, blessed be Your name
