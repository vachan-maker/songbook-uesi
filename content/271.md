These are the days of Elijah  
Declaring the word of the Lord  
And these are the days of your  
servant, Moses  
Righteousness being restored  
And though these are days of great trials  
Of famine and darkness and sword  
Still, we are the voice in the desert, crying  
“Prepare ye the way of the Lord!”  


Behold He comes, riding on the clouds  
Shining like the sun, at the trumpets call  
So lift your voice, it’s the year of Jubilee  
And out of Zion’s hill, salvation comes.

  
And these are the days of Ezekiel,  
The dry bones becoming as flesh  
And these are the days of your  
servant, David,  
Rebuilding the temple of praise.  
And these are the days of the harvest,  
The fields are as white in the world.  
And we are the laborers in your vineyard,  
Declaring the word of the Lord!  
(Behold He) 

 
There’s no God like Jehovah,  
There’s no God like Jehovah,  
There’s no God like Jehovah!
