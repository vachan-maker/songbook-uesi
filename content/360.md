I lay my life down at your feet  
You’re the only one I need,  
I turn to you and you are always there.  
In troubled times it’s you I seek,  
I put you first, that’s all I need,  
I humble all I am, all to you.  
  
One Way, Jesus!  
You’re the only one that  
I could live for (2)  
  
You are always, always there,  
Every how and everywhere,  
Your grace abounds so deeply within me.  
You will never ever change  
Yesterday today the same,  
Forever till forever meets no end.  
  
You are the way the truth and the life  
We live by faith and not by sight ...for You  
We’re living all for You
