I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,  
And it told Thy love to me;  
But I long to rise in the arms of faith,  
And be closer drawn to Thee.  
  
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,  
To the cross where Thou hast died;  
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,  
To Thy precious, bleeding side.  
  
Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,  
By the powâ€™r of grace divine;  
Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,  
And my will be lost in Thine.  
  
O the pure delight of a single hour  
That before Thy throne I spend,  
When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,  
I commune as friend with friend!  
  
There are depths of love that I yet may know  
Ere Thee face to face I see;  
There are heights of joy that I yet may reach  
Ere I rest in peace with Thee.
