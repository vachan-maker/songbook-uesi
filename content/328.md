Into my heart,  
Into my heart,  
Come into my heart, Lord Jesus.  
Come in today, Come in to stay,  
Come into my heart, Lord Jesus  
  
He’s in my heart,  
He’s in my heart,  
He’s in my heart, Forever.  
He’s here today, he’s here to stay,  
He’s in my heart, Forever  
  
Rule in my heart,  
Rule in my heart,  
Be king of my heart, Lord Jesus.  
Make this your throne; rule there alone  
Be king of my heart, Lord Jesus
