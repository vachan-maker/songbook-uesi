He Is My Everything, He Is My All.  
He Is My Everything, Both Great And Small.  
He Gave His Life For Me, Made Everything New.  
He Is My Everything, Now How About You?

For He Tastes Like Honey In The Rock  
O Taste And See That The Lord Is Good  
For He Tastes Like Honey In The Rock.  
  
O Taste And See That The Lord Is Good  
For He Tastes Like Honey In The Rock.
