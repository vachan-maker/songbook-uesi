No other name but the name of Jesus  
No other name but the name of the Lord  
No other name but the name of Jesus  
Is worthy of glory, and worthy of honor  
And worthy of power and all praise  
His name is exalted, far above the earth  
His name is high above the heavens  
His name is exalted, far above the earth  
Give glory and honor and praise unto  
His Name  
The Lord said Heâ€™ll answer, all of our  
prayers  
When we cry out in His Name  
His name is power, awesome to behold  
Give glory and honor and praise unto  
His Name
