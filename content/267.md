Oh God, You are my God  
And I will ever praise You  
Oh God, You are my God  
And, I will ever praise You  
  
I will seek You in the morning  
And I will learn to  
Walk in Your ways  
And step by step You'll lead me  
And I will follow You all of my days  
  
Oh God, You are my God  
And I will ever praise You  
Oh God, You are my God  
And, I will ever praise You  
  
I will seek You in the morning  
And I will learn to  
Walk in Your ways  
And step by step You'll lead me  
And I will follow You all of my days  
  
And I will follow You  
All of my days  
And I will follow You  
All of my days  
And step by step You'll lead me  
And I will follow You all of my days
